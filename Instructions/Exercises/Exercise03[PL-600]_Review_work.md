# Exercise - Review workbook

During this exercise, you will be reviewing the project workbook for the Contoso project created by another team of Solution Architects. Part of this exercise is deciding how best to manage your time. Make sure you find out from your instructor the time allotted.

## Learning Objectives

After completing the exercise, you will be able to:

- Perform evaluation of work produced by others effectively.
- Deliver constructive feedback to others.

## Exercise 1: Review Project Workbook details and prepare feedback

You will be assigned another team of Solution Architects to work with and exchange feedback.

Exchange a digital copy of your project workbook from Module 2 where you architected a high-level solution for Contoso with the other team.

As a team, review the other team’s workbook details and develop notes so you can go over the feedback with the other team later. Your notes should consider the following:

- High-level architecture diagram
  - Does it accurately represent the requirements?
  - How could it be improved?
- Dynamics 365 apps used
  - Did they use the appropriate Dynamics 365 apps for the requirements?
  - If you disagree with a decision, why?
- Fit Gap
  - Review the other team’s choices, do any seem wrong?
- Overall assessment
  - What did the team do well?
  - What could the team have improved?

## Exercise 2: Provide feedback to the other team

Take turns with the other team providing feedback to each other based on your review.

As the team providing feedback:

- Keep the feedback constructive.
- Provide examples of how to improve the proposed architecture don’t just say it’s wrong.
- Avoid coming across like you know everything!

As the team receiving feedback:

- Listen to the feedback, try not to interrupt.
- Try to not be defensive and listen to the ideas.
- Ask clarifying questions where the feedback isn’t clear.

If you have time, identify one requirement that you think is a very poorly written requirement.
