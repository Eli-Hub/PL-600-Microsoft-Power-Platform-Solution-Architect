# Exercise - Model data

In this exercise you will work as small groups. Review the information presented about Fabrikam Robotics and complete the tasks.

## Learning Objectives

After completing the exercise, you will:

- Evaluate customer requirements
- Make decisions for the data model

## Exercise 1

You are building a solution for Fabrikam to track visitors to a showroom and manufacturing site. Some of the visitors are potential purchasers and some are just there to see the magic of the robots working.

- Visitors must have a reserved spot to gain access.
- Visitors invited by sales staff must be tracked to a sales process
- Visitors just touring for fun are not tracked to a sales process.
- Visitors can bring guests.
- Each visitor must have a photo taken upon arrival and associated with their visit.
- Each visitor must sign a waiver of liability each time they visit, and you must store their signature and date time of acceptance.
- Each primary visitor is assigned an engagement tracking device that tracks their location in the manufacturing area and showroom. This is for safety as well as for improving the tours. The device stores the data in its own cloud service that offers both bulk export and API access.
- You must allow for the tracking data to be viewed in the sales process user interface used by the sales staff
- Marketing has asked to be able to view visits by day/month/quarter along with statistics on closing of sales after a visit.

### Tasks

Create a data model for the above requirements. Use whatever tool or medium that you have available to complete the data model. You can use a whiteboard, Visio, or pen and paper.

- How did you handle storing of visitor photos?
- How did you handle storing of visitor waiver acceptance and signature?
- How did you accommodate for viewing of tracking data in the sales process?
- Did you use anything from the Common Data Model schema?
- How did you handle marketingâ€™s statistics needs?
